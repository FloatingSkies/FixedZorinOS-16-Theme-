# An Fixed theme of ZorinOS 16 theme to support GTK4 and feel more cohesive through ZorinOS 17

## "What if we thought of 2021 when Zorin OS 16 was releasing? a new era of ZorinOS, the new dawn of Linux computers"

### This theme is more of an nostalgia effect, but I hope Zorin fans can take use of it
